Hey there! Before our session, this quick check-in helps us tailor the convo to what you need most. No pressure — just share what feels clear right now.

---

### 💼 Career Direction
Are you leaning toward the same kind of work (APIs, AWS, etc.), or exploring something new?

> _Example: I want to stay in platform/backend but maybe try a different industry._

---

### 🕰️ Work Style
Are you looking for full-time, contract, freelance, or something flexible?

> _Example: I want full-time but remote only._

---

### 📄 Resume
Do you already have a resume we can refine, or are we starting from scratch?

> _Example: I have a draft from 6 months ago that needs cleanup._

---

### ☁️ AWS/API Refresh
Would a refresher on AWS or APIs be helpful, or would you rather focus elsewhere?

> _Example: I’d like a walkthrough of IAM + Lambda roles again._

---

### 🚧 Blockers or Gaps
Anything in your way — motivation, confidence, clarity, skill gaps, imposter syndrome?

> _Example: I’ve been avoiding applying because I don’t feel up to speed._

---

### 📌 Tracking Goals
Are you open to using this repo + a GitHub Project board to track goals like job apps, resume tasks, and learning milestones?

> _Example: Yes, structure helps. Let’s do it._

We’ll adjust as we go — this just helps us hit the ground running. 💬💪
